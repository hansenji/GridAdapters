GridAdapters
============


* Sectioned Grid Adapter for cursors and lists
* Sticky Section Headers Grid Adapter useing emilsjolander's [StickyListHeaderListView](https://github.com/emilsjolander/StickyListHeaders)
* Group Adapter for cursors and lists


These six adapters handle the math and base logic so you only have to focus on creating and binding your views with either a cursor or a list as the data backing the adapter.

* * *
Note

The sample app uses 
* jakewharton's [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) for view injection
* Square's [ott](http://square.github.io/otto/) for event bus
* jeffdcamp's [dbtools-android](https://github.com/jeffdcamp/dbtools-android) for database access

Use of these libraries are not required to use the adapters. I just don't like doing things the long way.
